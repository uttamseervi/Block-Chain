## ⭕ ERC Standards – Just for Clarity

There are tons, but here are **the major ERC types** used in the market:

- **ERC-20**: Fungible tokens (SHIBA, BONE, etc.)
- **ERC-721**: NFTs — Non-fungible tokens
- **ERC-1155**: Multi-token standard — supports both fungible + NFTs
- **ERC-4626**: Tokenized Vaults (DeFi stuff)

---

## 🐶 1. SHIBA INU (SHIB) — The Meme Missile

- **Type**: ERC-20
- **Supply**: Started with 1 Quadrillion (lots were burned)
- **Purpose**: Meme coin, branding powerhouse
- **Use Case**: None originally, just hype + memes

### 🤯 Why It Went Viral:
- Elon Musk tweets
- Dogecoin hype carryover
- FOMO loop + zero cost entry
- "Dog-themed coin" narrative = instant meme traction

> 🔥 **Savage Fact**: SHIBA was basically created as a joke... and now it's an ecosystem. Like if Dogecoin had a baby with ambition.

---

## 🪴 2. BONE — The Utility Powerhouse

- **Type**: ERC-20
- **Total Supply**: 250 million (fixed)
- **Purpose**:
  - Governance token (Doggy DAO)
  - Gas token on Shibarium (Layer 2)
  - Earned via staking/liquidity mining on ShibaSwap

> 💀 **Real Talk**: SHIBA is the face, BONE is the spine. Without BONE, Shibarium would be a meme L2 with no fuel.

### 💬 Why Not Just Use SHIBA for All This?
> Because meme tokens are unpredictable. You don’t run a nation on who’s trending on Twitter.

---

## 🐾 3. LEASH — The Rare VIP Access Token

- **Type**: ERC-20
- **Supply**: ~107,646 tokens (ultra-limited)
- **Nickname**: "Doge Killer" (LOL)
- **Utility**:
  - Early access to NFT drops
  - Stake for rewards
  - Access to metaverse lands

> ⚔️ **Savage Analogy**: If SHIBA is the nightclub, LEASH is the velvet rope. Only the VIPs get through.

---

## 🌝 Shibarium — Layer 2 Without the Lame

- Not a separate blockchain — it’s a Layer 2 scaling solution
- **Consensus inherited from Ethereum**
- **Gas paid in BONE**
- Customized logic for Shiba ecosystem

> 🔍 **Smart Move**: Why build a full chain from scratch when you can piggyback on Ethereum and build faster?

---

## ✨ Shiba’s Big Brain Move:

> Meme coin? ✅  
> Real utility coin? ✅  
> Rare exclusive access token? ✅  
> DEX + NFT marketplace + Metaverse + Layer 2? ✅✅✅

**Even if SHIBA dies, they have a fallback empire.**

> 🧐 **Playbook Worth Stealing**.

## 💡 Now... What About HunterNote?

You asked:
> "Okay tell me if I create a token HunterNote — what utility can I create for this?"

Let’s go savage on this:

### Possible Ecosystem Tokens

| Token       | Role                          |
|-------------|-------------------------------|
| `$HNOTE`    | Meme/community/airdrops       |
| `$CLUE`     | Used in treasure hunts, clues |
| `$TRACK`    | Governance + staking          |

---

## 🧱 Treasure Hunt Game (Your Idea!)

- Users use $HNOTE to enter hunts
- $CLUE is rewarded through engagement
- Winning NFTs minted only through solving riddles
- Add GPS-based hunt if you go wild (real-world + metaverse)

> 🔥 **Example**: Only way to mint a legendary NFT? Be the first to decode a smart contract puzzle.

---

## 🖼️ NFTs with $HNOTE — Can I Do That?

> "Can I list NFTs only purchasable with HunterNote on OpenSea or do I need my own site?"

**Answer**:
- ✅ OpenSea supports custom ERC-20 tokens **on custom contracts** — so yes, but you need to do some dev work.
- 🔥 Better control + branding = Build your own site (even integrate with OpenSea APIs)
- ⚖️ Best of both worlds = List on your site and push to OpenSea too

---

## 🎭 Meme Tokens — Pure Hype or Real Play?

> "Okay tell me how meme tokens work — only hype or any utility?"

**90%** are just hype-driven.
But **smart projects** (like SHIBA) ride hype **then build real value** behind the scenes.

> 💀 Most meme tokens are like fireworks — loud for 10 seconds, then darkness.

SHIBA is the rare one that *launched a firework, then built a damn city underneath the smoke.*
